# functional_programing_algorithms_java
Repository with exercises using spring and lambdas.
It contains exercises and examples to guide the programmers solve it.

In order to resolve this task you need to read and analyze the examples in the examples folder, 
then you need to develop the solution of the algorithms folder, take in mind that the solutions 
provided by you must pass the unit testing into test folder.

// ToDo
// Create an entity Student, you should create it into the "entities" folder,
// add the below properties, {String:name, int:age, String:semester, String:university, Float:grade}
// Student example: {"Luis", 23, "9 semester", "UGTO", 9.8}
// Use the below list of universities: UAG, ITES, UNAM, UGTO, UANL, TECNM, BUAP

// Once you created the Student entity, generate a list of 10 students
// Using the created list develop the solution for all the next scenarios.

// Scenario 1. Return a list of students from BUAP university
// Scenario 2. Return a list of students with grade grater than to 8.5
// Scenario 3. Return a list of names (String) from students younger than 29 years old
// Scenario 4. Return a list of all universities (String) (no duplicates).
// Scenario 5. Return a list of students from UNAM, semester grater than 5 and grade grater or equals to 9.
// Scenario 6. Return a map of students (values) grouping them using the university (key).
// Example from scenario 6: {UNAM [Pedro, Andrea], UAG [Luis, Jose], TECNM [Carla, Emilio]}
// Scenario 7. Return a list of students ordered by semester ASC
// Scenario 8. Return a list of students ordered by semester DESC
